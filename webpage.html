<h2>
<b>WELCOME TO THUSHARAGIRI</b>
</h2>
<p>Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet here to form the Chalippuzha River. The river diverges into three waterfalls creating a snowy spray, which gives the name, 'Thusharagiri' a word which means the snow-capped mountain. Of the three waterfalls, the highest is the Thenpara, falling from an altitude of 75 metres (246 ft). The other two are the Erattumukku falls and Mazhavil Chattam falls.Thusharagiri Falls is a waterfall located in Kozhikode district in the Indian state of Kerala, India. Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet here to form the Chalippuzha River.Hence the area came to known as Thusharagiri - the mist capped mountain. 

To prevent mishaps, during peak monsoon, officials secure the area around the waterfalls with chains.

After monsoon, chains are removed. Then visitors are allowed access to get busy with refreshing dips.</p>
